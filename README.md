5. One of favourite anime character quotes is from Son Goku, and his quote about power: "Power comes in response to a need, not a desire. You have to create that need." Being physical strong or and capable in abilities does not matter, but rather abou having a purpose or motivation to use that power. Power is not something that can be attained simply by wanting it, but must be earned through hard work and determination.
