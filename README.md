## What I Learned:
1. How to build a full-stack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).
2. Implementing a GraphQL API with a Node.js and Express.js server.
3. Utilizing MongoDB and Mongoose ODM for database management.
4. Implemented user authentication using JWT.
5. Deploying a full MERN stack application on Heroku.
6. One of favourite anime character quotes is from Son Goku, and his quote about power: "Power comes in response to a need, not a desire. You have to create that need." Being physical strong or and capable in abilities does not matter, but rather abou having a purpose or motivation to use that power. Power is not something that can be attained simply by wanting it, but must be earned through hard work and determination.

### Continued Development:
1. Intellect, Discipline & Strength.
2. Improve the user interface and user experience with more advanced design and functionality.
3. Add a feature to allow users to create private events, which are accessible only to invited attendees.
4. Implement real-time notifications for event updates and reminders.
5. Integrate a map view to display the location of events.
6. Add social media sharing functionality to promote events.
7. Implement event ratings and reviews.
