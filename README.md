# Overview

## The Challenge:

## The Challenge

The challenge for our team was to develop a comprehensive event management application that offers a user-friendly interface and extensive functionality. The application needed to enable users to create, edit, and manage their events while also providing the ability to discover and attend events created by others. Our application ensures a seamless user experience, offering secure, responsive, and accessible features across various devices and screen sizes.

Our objectives for this challenge were as follows:

1. Authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.
2. Enable users to create, add, delete, and edit events, details include: location, date, time, and category.
3. Allow users to browse and filter events created by other users based on specific criteria such as location, date, time, and category.
4. Provide featurse for users to mark attendance at events view the events they are attending.
5. Ensure that the application is responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

Addressing these objectives, our teamed delivered an event management platform that met the needs of both event organizers and attendees, thus streamlining the event planning and participation process.


## Assigned User Story:
```
I want to be able to sign up, log in, and log out of the application securely.
